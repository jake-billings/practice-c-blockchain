This repository contains my personal practice with C++ in preparation for CS classes at CU Denver. Since this repository is just a practice repo, it is lacking in best practices and documentation. See the python implementation in my `research-blockchain` repository for cleaner code.

### Blockchain ###
This implementation of a blockchain in C++ is based off of a simplified version of the Bitcoin mining algorithm. See [research-blockchain](https://github.com/jake-billings/research-blockchain) for more information on the algorithm. The purpose of this repository is to replicate that algorithm in C++.
